        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            Fur a Better Life is a youth-led advocacy group formed in 2025 with one mission: to give stray animals the future they deserve. 
            We started as a small school project but grew into a movement after realizing the scale of the problem both locally and globally. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by the stories of abandoned pets and the struggles of animals on the streets, we decided to raise awareness 
            and support community-driven solutions like adoption, vaccination, and education campaigns.

        <p>
            We are a group of students and animal lovers committed to improving the lives of stray cats and dogs. 
            Each of us has seen firsthand the struggles of animals in our own neighborhoods, and together, 
            we hope to create a kinder, safer environment for them.
