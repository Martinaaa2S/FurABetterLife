    <!-- Background of the Problem -->
    <section>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            It is not rare to see stray cats and dogs roaming the streets, whether in your own neighborhood or across different countries. 
            These animals come from various backgrounds: some were abandoned by their owners, while others were born into life on the streets 
            and forced to endure hunger, illness, and exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Philippines, stray animal estimates have risen from about 12 million in 2019 to over 13 million as of 2024 (Philippine News Agency, 2023; Mindanews, 2025; Manila Times, 2025). 
            These large numbers pose a critical public health threat, particularly in relation to rabies, which remains a lethal risk in areas with limited vaccination coverage.
        </p>

    <!-- What is being done -->
    <section>
        <h2>Efforts to Address the Issue</h2>
        <p>
            In response to this crisis, several initiatives are being pursued in the Philippines. Senator Grace Poe has proposed the establishment of a specialized animal welfare bureau 
            under the Department of Agriculture, while Senator Mark Villar authored Senate Bill 2257 to grant tax incentives for adopters of stray animals. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Organizations such as the Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) continue to advocate for wider rabies vaccination campaigns. 
            However, financial and logistical challenges still prevent reaching the recommended 70% vaccination coverage. 
            These efforts show that while progress is being made, much more work is needed.
